# Loan Repayment Challenge
## Introduction
The following challenge asks you to work with a data set of loan repayment. It can be used to assess the risk of our applicants more accurately. Being successful in this objective enables us to better price customers and mitigate losses on our portfolio of loans. The hope is that it will force you to ask relevant questions about the data, do some preliminary exploration, perform the necessary manipulations or aggregations, generate visualizations, and reach conclusions or insights.
